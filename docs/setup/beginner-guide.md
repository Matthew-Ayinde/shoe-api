## Prerequisites

Before we start, you'll need to install several tools on your computer. Don't worry - we'll explain what each one does!

### Required Software

#### 1. Node.js (JavaScript Runtime)
**What it is:** Node.js allows you to run JavaScript on your computer (not just in web browsers).

**Installation:**
1. Go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
2. Download the LTS (Long Term Support) version
3. Run the installer and follow the prompts
4. Verify installation by opening terminal/command prompt and typing:
   ```bash
   node --version
   npm --version
   ```
   You should see version numbers for both commands.

#### 2. MongoDB (Database)
**What it is:** MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents.

**Installation Options:**

**Option A: MongoDB Community Server (Local Installation)**
1. Go to [mongodb.com/try/download/community](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)
2. Download for your operating system
3. Install following the setup wizard
4. Start MongoDB service:
   - **Windows:** MongoDB should start automatically as a service
   - **macOS:** Run `brew services start mongodb/brew/mongodb-community`
   - **Linux:** Run `sudo systemctl start mongod`

**Option B: MongoDB Atlas (Cloud Database - Recommended for Beginners)**
1. Go to [mongodb.com/atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas)
2. Create a free account
3. Create a new cluster (free tier available)
4. Get your connection string (we'll use this later)

#### 3. Redis (Optional but Recommended)
**What it is:** Redis is an in-memory data store used for caching to make your API faster.

**Installation:**
- **Windows:** Download from [redis.io/download](https://redis.io/download) or use WSL
- **macOS:** Run `brew install redis`
- **Linux:** Run `sudo apt-get install redis-server`

**Start Redis:**
```bash
redis-server
```

#### 4. Git (Version Control)
**What it is:** Git helps you track changes in your code and collaborate with others.

**Installation:**
1. Go to [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/)
2. Download and install for your operating system
3. Verify: `git --version`

#### 5. Code Editor
**Recommended:** Visual Studio Code from [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

**Useful Extensions for VS Code:**
- JavaScript (ES6) code snippets
- Prettier - Code formatter
- ESLint
- Thunder Client (for API testing)
- MongoDB for VS Code

## Step-by-Step Installation

### Step 1: Get the Code

1. **Open your terminal/command prompt**
2. **Navigate to where you want to store the project:**
   ```bash
   cd Desktop  # or wherever you prefer
   ```
3. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd shoe-api
   ```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

**What are dependencies?** These are pre-written code packages that our API uses to function.

```bash
npm install
```

This command reads the `package.json` file and installs all required packages. You'll see a `node_modules` folder created - this contains all the dependencies.

### Step 3: Environment Configuration

**What is environment configuration?** These are settings that change based on where your app runs (development, testing, production).

1. **Copy the example environment file:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. **Open the `.env` file in your code editor and configure it:**

```bash
# Basic Configuration
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=5000

# Database Configuration
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/shoe-store
# If using MongoDB Atlas, replace with your connection string:
# MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/shoe-store

# JWT (Authentication) Configuration
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-this-in-production
JWT_EXPIRE=7d

# Redis Configuration (Optional)
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379

# Email Configuration (for sending emails)
EMAIL_FROM=noreply@yourstore.com
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password

# Cloudinary (Image Storage) - Sign up at cloudinary.com
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your-cloud-name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your-api-key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your-api-secret

# Stripe (Payment Processing) - Sign up at stripe.com
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your-stripe-secret-key
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your-webhook-secret

# Google OAuth (Optional)
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-client-secret

# Frontend URL (for CORS)
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### Step 4: Set Up External Services

#### Cloudinary (Image Storage)
1. Go to [cloudinary.com](https://cloudinary.com/) and create a free account
2. In your dashboard, find your Cloud Name, API Key, and API Secret
3. Add these to your `.env` file

#### Stripe (Payment Processing)
1. Go to [stripe.com](https://stripe.com/) and create an account
2. In your dashboard, go to Developers > API Keys
3. Copy your Secret Key (starts with `sk_test_`)
4. Add it to your `.env` file

#### Email Service (Gmail Example)
1. Enable 2-factor authentication on your Gmail account
2. Generate an App Password:
   - Go to Google Account settings
   - Security > 2-Step Verification > App passwords
   - Generate password for "Mail"
3. Use this app password in your `.env` file

### Step 5: Initialize the Database

**What this does:** Creates the initial database structure and adds some sample data.

```bash
npm run seed
```

This command will:
- Connect to your MongoDB database
- Create necessary collections (tables)
- Add sample products, users, and categories
- Set up database indexes for better performance

### Step 6: Start the Application

```bash
npm run dev
```

**What happens when you run this:**
1. Node.js starts the Express server
2. Connects to MongoDB database
3. Connects to Redis (if configured)
4. Sets up all API routes
5. Starts listening for requests on port 5000

You should see output like:
```
ðŸš€ Server running on port 5000
âœ… MongoDB connected successfully
âœ… Redis connected successfully
ðŸ“Š Database seeded with sample data
```

PORT=5000            # Which port the server listens on
MONGODB_URI=...      # Where to find the database
JWT_SECRET=...       # Secret key for creating authentication tokens
```

### Package.json Scripts
These are shortcuts for common tasks:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node src/server.js",           // Start in production
    "dev": "nodemon src/server.js",          // Start with auto-restart
    "test": "jest",                          // Run tests
    "seed": "node src/scripts/seed.js"       // Add sample data
  }
}
```

### Database Connection
The app connects to MongoDB using the connection string in `MONGODB_URI`:

```javascript
// Local MongoDB
mongodb://localhost:27017/shoe-store

// MongoDB Atlas (cloud)
mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/shoe-store
```

## Testing Your Setup

### 1. Health Check
Open your browser and go to: `http://localhost:5000/api/health`

You should see:
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "API is running",
  "timestamp": "2023-07-01T10:00:00.000Z"
}
```

### 2. API Testing with Thunder Client (VS Code Extension)

1. Install Thunder Client extension in VS Code
2. Create a new request
3. Test these endpoints:

**Get Products:**
- Method: GET
- URL: `http://localhost:5000/api/products`

**Register User:**
- Method: POST
- URL: `http://localhost:5000/api/auth/register`
- Body (JSON):
```json
{
  "email": "test@example.com",
  "password": "password123",
  "profile": {
    "firstName": "Test",
    "lastName": "User"
  }
}
```

### 3. Database Verification

**Using MongoDB Compass (GUI Tool):**
1. Download MongoDB Compass from [mongodb.com/products/compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass)
2. Connect using your MongoDB URI
3. You should see a `shoe-store` database with collections like `users`, `products`, `orders`

**Using Command Line:**
```bash
mongo  # or mongosh for newer versions
use shoe-store
show collections
db.products.find().limit(5)  # Show first 5 products
```

## Common Issues and Solutions
